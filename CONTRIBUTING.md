## Contributor License Agreements

Our project is open source under the terms outlined in the [LICENSE](LICENSE)
and [PATENTS](PATENTS) files. Before we can accept your contributions, even for
small changes, there are just a few small guidelines you need to follow:

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement
(CLA) with Google. JPEG XL Project is an effort by multiple individuals and
companies, including the initial contributors Cloudinary and Google, but Google
is the legal entity in charge of receiving these CLA and relicensing this
software:

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
  own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual
  CLA](https://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).

  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
  then you'll need to sign a [corporate
  CLA](https://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able
to accept your pull requests.

***NOTE***: Only original source code from you and other people that have signed
the CLA can be accepted into the main repository.
